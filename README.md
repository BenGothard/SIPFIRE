# SIPFIRE

This repository hosts the static SIPFIRE site for GitHub Pages. The project introduces the SIPFIRE philosophy—mastering life through seven core disciplines (Spiritual, Intellectual, Physical, Financial, Industrial, Relational, Emotional)—and encourages daily compounding actions supported by the SIPFIRE token.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the site locally.
2. Deploy the `main` branch with GitHub Pages (build from the root) to make the site public.

## Customization

- Adjust the content in `index.html` to update copy or add additional sections.
- Update `styles.css` for theming and layout tweaks.
- Modify `script.js` to expand interactions such as progress tracking, clipboard sharing, or token simulations.
